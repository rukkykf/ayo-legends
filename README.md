The Ayo Legends game is a hybrid implementation of the popular Yoruba game Ayo. There are varying mechanics of play but the mechanics
used in this implementation are the mechanics used in Myriad Softwares Awale Shareware.

### What is this repository for?

The Ayo Legends game served as my senior project in college. To summarize essential parts of the project briefly:

There are two types of games in literature, games of progression and emergent games. Traditionally, the Ayo game
is an emergent game and this means that the game's challenge is derived primarily from playing according to a set of rules.
Other examples of emergent games are chess, checkers, monopoly.

Games of progression however present the game challenge to the player
in levels of difficulty that are usually driven by a story line. A good example of a game of progression is Candy Crush.
Hybrid games incorporate elements of emergence and progression and most modern games are hybrids.
The goal of this project was to implement the Ayo game as a hybrid game by incorporating progression mechanics
that are facilitated by a storyline.

The story mode is currently working fine. The algorithm implemented for the AI in levels 2 and 3 are the minimax algorithm
with a depth of 1 and 2 respectively.

### How do I get set up?

so there are two folders:

1.) The setup folder which contains the setup file and should be able to run on any Windows PC

2.) The scripts folder which contains the scripts from the Unity project. The scripts can be viewed in any text editor
